# twin-prime-xor-law
Discovery, proof and large-scale computational validation of a new binary law for twin primes. Includes a high-performance C++ miner capable of scanning up to billions of twin prime pairs and confirming the exact XOR identity  𝑝 ⊕ ( 𝑝 + 2 ) = 2 𝑣 2 ( 𝑝 + 1 ) + 1 − 2 p⊕(p+2)=2 v 2 (p+1)+1 −2.
